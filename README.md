# kotlin-while-else

A kotlin library providing a while-else functionality.

This is meant as a joke, duh.  
Though maybe it really is useful for frontend development when displaying lists or fallbacks otherwise.
Who knows.

Usage:

```kotlin
While (::canHasCookie) {
    println("i got cookie")
} Else {
    println("i got no cookie :(")
}
```
